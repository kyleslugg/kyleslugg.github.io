# Welcome! I'm Kyle Slugg-Urbino

I blend policy analysis and data science to figure out how urban governance can promote racial and economic justice, so that all New Yorkers share in our city's prosperity.

As a former translator, I am keenly aware of how making change depends on turning messy facts and data into a strong, compelling narrative that will drive policymakers to action. I take pride in my ability to make complex topics understandable to non-technical decisionmakers as well as the public, using both clear writing and compelling visuals. Let's figure out how we can work together to make urban space function better for all of us.

My areas of expertise include:

Statistical modeling using Stata and Python
Geospatial Analysis and Analytic Mapping
Real Estate Market Analysis
Data Visualization
Policy Writing
