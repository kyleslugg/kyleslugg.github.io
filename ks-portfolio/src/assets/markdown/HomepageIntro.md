Welcome! I'm Kyle Slugg-Urbino. I build apps (mostly in React.js +
Typescript on the frontend and Node.js or Python on the back) and
cities (mainly New York), sometimes at the same time (when I'm
creating a routing tool or web map). In brief, I live to give people tools to make the abstract and complex systems they live within visible -- and, so, accessible to challenge.
