## Environmental Hazards in NYC

Please note this test project is a work in progress and is not a NYC Planning product.

New York City has some of the most progressive environmental policies; yet, its century-old buildings, legacy infrastructure, and long industrial history have left many environmental hazards to remediate. These hazards include combined sewers, brownfields, Superfund sites, buildings that burn heavy heating oil, among others. Day-to-day urban activity contributes to oil and chemical spills, meanwhile climate change and extreme weather events pose a growing threat.
