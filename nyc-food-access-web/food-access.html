        <p>Uneven access to fresh foods is a perennial issue for many
          American. Wealthy urban areas frequently feature an
          abundance of markets and specialty stores offering a range of
          nutritious options, while automobile-oriented suburban environments
          offer those who are able to drive ready access to supermarkets. By
          contrast, less-well-off urban areas (and rural areas where low
          population density discourages services development) have traditionally been neglected
          by chain supermarkets and specialty stores, leaving residents to find
          sustenance from more convenient but less nutritious sources.</p>

        <p>New York City is no exception: anecdotally, fresh
          food retailers are far sparser in areas such as outer Brooklyn,
          eastern Queens, and the Bronx than in much of Manhattan or in
          wealthier areas of the outer boroughs. This is doubly true of the
          corridors near transit stations that are frequented by commuters; in
          these areas, quick-service delis and bodegas offer convenience that few
          full-service groceries can match.</p>

        <p>However, the empirical study of "food deserts" (which are defined by
          a range of metrics, including a lack of access to fresh food combined
          with some element of socioeconomic disadvantage) in
          urban areas is made difficult by the nature of the urban food retail
          landscape. New Yorkers purchase fresh foods not only from supermarkets -- the only sources
          of fresh food included in many "food desert" metrics, including those
          in the
          USDA's Food Access Research Atlas -- but also from small
          produce markets and local grocery chains that offer a lifeline in
          areas where real estate is too expensive or demand is too low to
          support a large-footprint store. What is more, distance-based
          metrics of food access fail to capture the time costs associated with
          seeking fresh foods over prepared foods in areas where a glut of the
          latter are readily available: what does it matter that a produce
          market is 1/2 mile away if a stretch of bodegas and take-out
          establishments greet hungry and time-crunched commuters as they step
          off the train?</p>

        <h3>Walking Time to Fresh-Food Retailers</h3>
        <!--Markets map-->
        <div id="map-container" class="map-container" style="height: 548px;
      float: center;">
          <iframe src="./map.html" frameborder="0" style="border:0;" width=800 height=548 float="center"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p><br>In order to paint a more complete and realistic picture of New
          Yorkers' food options, I visualize supermarkets, grocery stores, and
          greengrocers that are included in OpenStreetMap's database of places.
          Because this source is community-generated, it is able to account for
          smaller fresh-food providers than those listed in, for example, New
          York State's database of supermarkets, while also filtering out
          establishments such as bodegas that are nominally food retailers but
          which do not offer a full complement of grocery options. I then
          create 5-, 7-, and 10-minute walking isochrones around each of these
          stores, representing areas that have relatively convenient access to
          fresh foods, rather than merely the ostensible access suggested by
          physical proximity.</p>

        <h3>Fresh-Food Access and Socioeconomic Advantage</h3>
        <!--Tract map-->
        <div id="map-container" class="map-container" style="height: 548px">
          <iframe src="./tracts_2.html" frameborder="0" style="border:0" width=800 height=548 scrolling=no></iframe>
        </div>
        <p><br>I also visualize market locations against three markers of
          socioeconomic (dis)advantage at the Census Tract level: median
          income, racial composition (specifically, the percentage of tract
          residents identifying as nonwhite in 2014-2018 American Community
          Survey estimates), and median age. Though this illustration is merely
          suggestive of the dynamics underpinning disparities in food access,
          the concentration of markets in wealthy, largely white areas within
          the city is clearly visible.</p>
